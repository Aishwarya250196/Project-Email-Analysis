# Project-Email-Analysis
Use case for analyzing email data to identify valid and junk emails, addressing server memory issues caused by spam while ensuring important communications are not missed.

# Email Domain and Validity Analysis

## Project Overview

This project addresses a common issue faced by organizations: identifying junk emails and domains that cause memory issues on email servers, which results in missing valid emails from genuine senders. The goal of this use case is to create a Python-based solution to identify and classify valid and invalid emails and domains from a mixed dataset.

## Use Case

The organization is encountering server memory problems due to an influx of emails from junk domains, causing critical emails to be missed. The objective is to create a temporary dataset containing both valid and invalid email addresses, then develop a Python script to analyze and resolve the following:

### Key Questions

1. **List valid emails**: Identify all emails that are valid and should receive more attention.
2. **List valid domains**: Extract all valid domains from the email addresses for whitelisting.
3. **List invalid emails**: Detect emails that are improperly formatted or from junk domains.
4. **List invalid domains**: Identify domains associated with junk emails.
5. **Create a mapper of valid domains and their respective emails**: Establish a mapping of valid domains to the emails originating from those domains.

## Solution Approach

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Create a dataset of email addresses, including a mix of valid and invalid email addresses and domains.
   - Store this data in a file format that is easy to process (e.g., JSON or TXT).

2. **Analysis and Processing**:
   - Use Python to read the dataset and process the email addresses.
   - Leverage regular expressions to distinguish between valid and invalid emails based on a typical email format (e.g., `username@domain.extension`).
   - Separate the domains from the email addresses and categorize them into valid and invalid domains.
   - Create a mapping between valid domains and their respective valid email addresses.

## Expected Outcomes

1. **List of valid emails**: A clear list of emails that conform to the expected format and originate from trusted domains.
2. **List of valid domains**: A list of recognized domains that are identified as legitimate sources of communication.
3. **List of invalid emails**: A collection of emails that do not follow proper formatting or come from spammy sources.
4. **List of invalid domains**: A set of domains associated with junk emails or potential threats.
5. **Mapping of valid domains to emails**: A dictionary or mapping that connects valid domains to the corresponding valid emails.

## Conclusion

This project aims to help organizations address the problem of junk emails clogging up their server and missing valid communications. By implementing this solution, organizations can improve their email management, focus on legitimate emails, and reduce server memory issues.
